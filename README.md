### <a name="design-iphone">iPhone layout</a>

iPhone se 2020 was taken as a basis.
All the dimensions and layout of the main elements were taken from the official [Apple website](https://www.apple.com/iphone-se/specs/).

*- iPhone sizes*

**Based on the found layouts , it was decided to take the following sizes as a basis:**

**iPhone height:** 138px;

**iPhone width:** 67px.

**According to screen resolution (16x9):**

**Screen height:** 16px;

**Screen height:** 9px.

The base sizes will change (x5, for example) during development to match the actual size of the iPhone.

*- Apple EULA*

To avoid license issues, it was decided to use a free Roboto font similar to SF Pro. 
The comparison is shown in the image:
